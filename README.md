# Beyond Performance Music (BPM) Arena
Have you ever wanted to go to a concert but you couldn't because the artist
was only performing the US tour? Or, because it was too far or, let's be
honest, you didn't have the money...

For this reason, we have built Beyond Performance Music (BPM) Arena. The idea
of this 3D real-time application is to connect a concert with those fans that
could not assist presentially.

In this platform, you can dance, say hello or even chat with other online
assistants while you're listening your favourite artist.

## Stack

This application have been built purely on `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

Also, we have built our [own backend](https://github.com/alexVera99/ecv-backend)
in `Node.js` for user authentication and Websocket operations to syncronize
the users and to implement the chat. In addition, for video streaming,
we have used `PeerJS`.
